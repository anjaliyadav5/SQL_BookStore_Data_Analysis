# Book Store Data Analysis

## Overview

This project contains an SQL-based analysis of a bookstore database. The goal is to explore sales, customers, books, authors, and inventory to answer common business questions such as revenue trends, best‑selling books, and customer behavior.

The core of the project is the SQL script:

```
BookStore_Data_Analysis.sql
```

* Analytical SQL queries
* Business‑oriented insights such as:

  * Top‑selling books and authors
  * Revenue by category or time period
  * Customer purchase patterns
  * Inventory and stock insights

## Requirements

To run this project, you’ll need:

* A relational database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)

> ⚠️ Note: You may need to slightly adjust syntax depending on the database engine you use.

## How to Use

1. Create a new database in your SQL environment.
2. Import or create the required tables (based on your schema).
3. Open `BookStore_Data_Analysis.sql` in your SQL editor.
4. Run the queries section by section.
